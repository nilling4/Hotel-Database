**Possible Challenges & Work Dynamic:**

- If a group member gets sick / is unable to complete their assigned tasks, we are planning on supporting them by moving around tasks and splitting the work between the other 2 members. 
- Noel and Babak are going to be working on the backend together so if there are any problems with not knowing how to approach any of the tasks then they will be able to ask each other questions


**Things left to do:**

- Determine styling of frontend / color theme
- Determine layout of buttons
